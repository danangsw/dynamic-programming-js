 * The dynamic data structure
 * Store elements sequntially but don't store the elements contiguously like an array.
 * Arrays:
 * - fixed size
 * - inefficient insertions and deletions
 * - random access
 * - may result in much memory waste
 * - sequential access is faster (elements in contiguously)

 * Linked List:

 * - NO random access
 * - NO memory waste
