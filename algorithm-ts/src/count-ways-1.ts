 * 
 * Complete the 'countWays' function below.
 * In this HackerRank Counting, the Ways problem solution Little Walter likes playing with his toy scales. He has N types of weights. The Ith weight type has weight Ai. There are infinitely many weights of each type.
 * Recently, Walter defined a function, F(X), denoting the number of different ways to combine several weights so their total weight is equal to X. Ways are considered to be different if there is a type that has a different number of weights used in these two ways.
 * 
 * 
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. INTEGER_ARRAY arr
 *  2. LONG_INTEGER l
 *  3. LONG_INTEGER r
